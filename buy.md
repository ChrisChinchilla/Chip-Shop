## Print at Home
Currently Chip Shop is available as a print at home version. It's graphically simple, but all components fit on A4 sheets and playability is the same. All purchasers will be notified as this base version of the game is updated to fix issues.

In addition to the files received, you will need generic counters to represent money, resources and markers in the game.

For now, [purchase is handled by Snappy Checkout](https://www.snappycheckout.com/pay?31YOG9XTDFZOF39XWOODP3183) and you can 'pay what you feel' for the print at home version of Chip Shop. You will receive an email with download details.

## Boxed Version
We are working towards funding a proper boxed version of the game, [sign up to the mailing list](http://eepurl.com/bweh1n) to be kept up to date.

## Want to Play Test, Review or a Free Copy?
If you would like a free copy of Chip Shop for testing, review or can't afford to pay? This is fine, we want people to play the game. So we can track where copies go, please send [us an email](mailto:chrischinchilla+jwexqhfzdlssfwzneupb@boards.trello.com) and we will get a copy to you.
