After ten turns the game is over!

If at the end of the final build phase of the final turn a player has products still in production or personalities with requirements yet to be met then there are negative affects to scores.

For each product or personality a player discards they lose half of the loyalty and longevity scores of each card.

After this all scores are combined, any special cards considered and applied and the player with the most points wins.

## Scoring during the game
On the score board, each player has three score tracks that match their color. There are tokens to represent the current denomination of your score and the units within it, for example:

If your current score is 13, place 1 '10' value token in the denomination square and your player token at 3 in the units track. When your score reaches 22, you add a second 10 token to the denomination square and move your player token to 2 in the units track.

There are three scoring tracks in Chip Shop and all are of equal importance in winning the game:

## Profit
This represents the amount you've sold throughout the game. It's the easiest to gain, but also the most competitive amongst other players.

## Longevity
Was (and is) your company a bright light that burn out fast or has it laid the ground for a long and sustainable future?

## Loyalty
Did you just churn our products that no one wanted or loved or did you create sources of wonder and inspiration in your customer base?
