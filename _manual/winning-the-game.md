After ten turns all scores are combined, any special cards considered and included and the player with the most points wins!

# Scoring during the game
On the score board, each player has three score tracks that match their colour. There are tokens to represent the current denomination of your score and the units within it, for example:

If your current score is 13, place 1 '10' value token in the denomination square and your player token at 3 in the units track. When your score reaches 22, you add a second 10 token to the denomination square and move your player token to 2 in the units track.

There are three scoring tracks in Chip and all are of equal importance in winning the game:

# Profit
This represents the amount you've sold throughout the game. It's the easiest to gain, but also likely the most competitive amongst other players. At the end of the game your profits (or losses) are likely to be in the 100s of thousands or the millions, so to get your final score divide by 100,000.

# Longevity
Was (and is) your company a bright light that burn out fast or has it laid the ground for a long and sustainable future?

# Loyalty
Did you just churn our products that no one really wanted or loved or did you create sources of wonder and inspiration in your customer base?

The last two scores you are likely to receive numbers ranging between 0 and 20.
