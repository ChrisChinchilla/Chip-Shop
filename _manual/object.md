The aim of Chip Shop is to survive a decade, building and releasing products to match your ideals for the company. There are three score tracks in the game: profit, longevity and loyalty and you can choose which path(s) you wish to follow.

By spending money you will need to gain resources for staff, quality, R&D and marketing to build products that will then affect your scores. Players are generally working on their products in secret, with only personalities and scores public to other players.

During the course of the game certain personalities and specialists may be attracted to your company and will bring certain positive and negative effects. Every turn (a year) players draw event cards and these will also affect a player or players.

After ten years / rounds scores are totalled and the player with the highest score wins.
