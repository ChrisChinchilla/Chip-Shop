4. Draw Personalities
5. Draw Products
6. Build and Adjust scores

## Receive money for successful products
In this phase you receive money for any products that you already have built. Everything needs money. You receive it from selling products and spend it on pretty much everything else. If you ever run out of money you are declared bankrupt and are out of the game.

## Buy and Allocate Resources to Costs
Unless affected by events or personalities, 1 resource = 1 money. Buy what you need or think you will need for future products. Then allocate these resources to the costs you will need for products you are building this turn or in subsequent turns.

### Staff
You need people to make anything happen, but they are expensive and you will need money to keep them around, or they will leave you. You always need at least one staff member, if you run out of staff for whatever reason you are out of the game.

### Quality
Products demand a certain level of quality for their return with shoddy products quicker and cheaper to produce, but generally resulting in less return. Quality products will result in a greater return but require a far greater investment.

### Research & Development
Good ideas aren't (always) conjured out of thin air. They take months and years of painstaking research and testing to perfect. Your R&D score dictates how many cards you draw from the product deck every turn.

### Marketing
There's no point having a great idea and product if no ones going to hear about it. This represents your investment in getting the word out and promoting your product. It also represents how familiar people are with the product, a higher value indicates you need to undertake more work to convince people they need it.

## Events
Despite your best effort for planning and strategy, life has a habit of throwing up random occurrences that help or hinder your plans. This is represented by the events deck which contains varying positive and negative affects for you, other players and the game.

Every player draws two cards in player order, one after the other:

If an event card is public, show it to all players and then follow where and when it should be played.
- If an event happens immediately, play it.
- If an effect of the card is to draw more cards or other actions, play them immediately.
- If it is an event that can be played when you wish, hold on to it for future usage.

## Draw Personalities
These are special individuals who you may want to recruit to your company, they may also decide to join your company at their own free will. These personalities all have specialties, skills and traits that will positively affect your statistics and chances of winning the game. Every player draws in player order a number of personality cards determined by Quality plus Loyalty, divided by two (rounded down). A player can draw up to this number but may only 'play' up to half of them (rounded down). If a player can 'play' a personality, I.e. They have the requisite scores that a personality demands, that personality enters play immediately and their effects are felt. If the personality is public, they are made public.

## Draw products
These are the main crux of Chip Shop and you must create these during the game to score any points and stand any chance of winning. Some are easy and can be completed quickly, others are harder and will require more time and resources. Each will require a combination of varying levels of cost and result in a certain increase in your score. Each may also have a range of other factors such as time limits, one-off or recurring costs and positive or negative effects. Players may draw a number of cards up to their current Research & Development value, but may only keep up to two. These represent products that you have actively decided to work on. All products have costs that may be met, if you can build it straight away you still have to wait until the next phase, otherwise it is built when you have the resources necessary. Remember that products that are never completed will also cost you at the end of the game.

Whilst you are working on a product it remains private in the R&D area of your factory. It remains private until built or other event makes it public.

### Accessories
Accessory products are always attached to an exisiting non-accessory product. Each accessory will specifiy what it can be attached to and any other requirements. Unless specified, an accessory remains in play for as long as the product is attached to. Proportional costs and scores for accessories are always a proportion of the product it is attached to.

## Build
If at the beginning of the build phase you don't have enough resources to sustain your current products and personalities you must discard products until you can. For each product or personality discarded you lose half of the loyalty and longevity scores of the card.

If you have cards in your R&D stack that can be built, they are built in this phase. Move the product card from your factory into the public playing area. Scores are adjusted, any revenue the product brings you doesn't occur until the beginning of the next turn.
