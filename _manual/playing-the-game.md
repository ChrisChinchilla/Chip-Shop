# Starting the Game
Use your favorite method for randomly selecting a starting player and play lasts for ten turns.

# Phases per Turn
Each turn consists of 6 short phases, these happen with all players undertaking each in sequence, clockwise. A turn ends after the last player has completed phase 6.

1. Receive money for successful products (Not in 1st turn)
2. Buy and allocate resources to costs
3. Draw and play events
4. Draw and bring personalities into play
5. Draw products
6. Build products and adjust scores

## Receive money for successful products (Not in 1st turn)
In this phase players receive money for any products already built. Everything in Chip Shop needs money. Selling products makes money and it's spend on everything else. If a player runs out of money they are declared [bankrupt](concepts/bankrupt) and must start the game again as a new company (as in setup phase).

> Jane built the [Atari 5200](cards/Atari_5200) last turn and so receives 4 money. She intends to build a [control pad](cards/Control_pad) accessory to attach the console and thus buys one Staff, R&D and Marketing resource, saving one money for future use.

## Buy and allocate resources to costs
Unless affected by events or personalities, 1 resource of any kind = 1 money. Players need to plan for what they think they will need for products in production and potential future products. Players then allocate these resources to the accumulative costs required for products in [production](concepts/inproduction).

### Staff
Staff are needed to make most things happen, but they are expensive and money is needed to keep them around, or they will leave. Players always need at least one staff member available or allocated to products in production. If a player runs out of staff they are declared [bankrupt](concepts/bankrupt) and must start the game again as a new company (as in setup phase).

### Quality
Products require a certain level of quality to balance potential profit and customer satisfaction. Quality products will result in a greater return but require a far greater investment. Shoddier products are quicker and cheaper to make but will result in lower loyalty and longevity.

### Research & Development
Good ideas aren't (always) conjured out of thin air. They take months and years of painstaking research and testing to perfect. The R&D score dictates how many cards a player can draw from the product deck every turn.

### Marketing
There's no point having a great idea and product if no one hears about it. Marketing resources represent an investment in the promotion of a product. It can also represent how familiar people are with the concepts behind a product. A higher marketing value indicates the need to undertake more work to convince people they need it.

> Following from the previous phase, Jane intends to build a [control pad](cards/Control_pad) accessory to attach the [Atari 5200](cards/Atari_5200) and thus buys one Staff, R&D and Marketing resource, saving one money for future use.

## Draw and play events
Despite best efforts in planning and strategy, life has a habit of throwing random occurrences that help or hinder plans. This is represented by the events deck which contains varying positive and negative affects for individual players, all players and the game.

Every player draws two cards in player order:

If an event card is [public](concepts/public), the drawing player must show it to all players and then follow where and when it should be played.

- If an event is marked as [immediate](concepts/immediate), play it immediately.
- If an effect of the card is to draw more cards or other actions, play them immediately.
- If an event card is marked as '[choice](concepts/choice)' a player may hold on to the card to play when they wish.

## Draw and bring personalities into play
These are special individuals who players may want to recruit to their company. Personalities may also decide to join a players company at their own free will. Personalities all have specialties, skills and traits that will positively affect statistics and chances of winning the game. Every player draws in player order a number of personality cards determined by their current _Quality_ plus _Loyalty_ scores, divided by two (rounded down).

If a player can 'play' a personality, i.e. They have the requisite costs and prerequisites that a personality demands, that personality enters play immediately and their effects enacted. If the personality is [public](concepts/public), they are immediately made public. Any personality cards drawn that a player can't or doesn't want to bring into play are added back the top of the personality card deck before the next player draws.

> John's current _Quality_ score is four and _Loyalty_ score is five, thus John draws four personality cards (9 divided by 2, rounded down to 4). He can afford to employ one personality and replaces the remaing three on the top of the deck.

## Draw products
Products are the main point of Chip Shop and players must produce them during the game to stand any chance of winning. Some are easy and can be completed quickly, others are harder and will require more time and resources. Each will require a combination of cost values and result in a certain change in scores.

Each product may have a range of other factors such as the number of turns it produces profit, one-off or recurring costs and positive or negative effects.

Players may draw a number of cards from the products deck up to their current Research & Development value, but may only keep a maximum of two. This represent products that players have actively decided to work on.

All products have cost and resource requirements that must be met. If a player  can build a product immediately they may do so in the build phase. Otherwise a product is built when a player has the resources required. Remember that products that are never completed will negatively affect scores at the end of the game.

Whilst a player is working on a product it remains private in the R&D area of a players factory. The product remains private until built or other events make it public.

### Accessories
Accessory products are always attached to an exisiting non-accessory product. Each accessory will specify what it can be attached to and any other requirements. Unless specified, an accessory remains in play for as long as the product it is attached to is in play.

Proportional costs and scores for accessories (i.e costs and scores indicated as a fraction value) are always a proportion of the product it is attached to.

## Build products and adjust scores
If players have products in production that can be built, they are built in this phase. In turn order players should move the product card from their factory into the public playing area. Scores are adjusted, but any revenue the product brings doesn't occur until the beginning of the next turn.

> Following from the previous example, Jane successfully builds a [control pad](cards/Control_pad) and attaches it to her [Atari 5200](cards/Atari_5200). The profit score for the Atari 5200 is four per turn for two turns, thus the control pad attached to it gains one profit (a quarter of 4 is 1) per turn for as long as the Atari 5200 remains in play.
