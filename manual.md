# Introduction
It is the dawn of a new era, with computers becoming affordable and desirable enough that millions now want them in their homes.

In Chip Shop you play the head of a fledgling computer company in 80s America striving for a piece of that action. You have a decade to make your mark, will it be for longevity, loyalty, units shifted or striking a balance between them all?

Throughout a decade as you attempt to build your empire, personalities and events will help and hinder you. Will you be in a position to cope or will they be your downfall?

What about your competitors? Will they be working on something bigger, better and brighter than you? Or just steal your ideas from under your feet and beat you to the hearts of the public.

## Expansions
Chip Shop will start in the American 1980s, expansions are planned to allow for game play in different eras, regions and markets.

Aside from official expansions or 'updates', we intend to open source the tools and resources used to create the game and allow the community to create their own additions, or 'patches'.

# Object of the game
The aim of Chip Shop is to survive a decade, building and releasing products to match your ideals for the company. There are three score tracks in the game: profit, longevity and loyalty and you can choose which path(s) you wish to follow.

By spending money you will need to gain resources for staff, quality, R&D and marketing to build products that will then affect your scores. Players are generally working on their products in secret, with only personalities and scores public to other players.

During the course of the game certain personalities and specialists may be attracted to your company and will bring certain positive and negative effects. Every turn (a year) players draw event cards and these will also affect a player or players.

After ten years / rounds scores are totalled and the player with the highest score wins.

# Playing the game
## Starting the Game
Use your favorite method for randomly selecting a starting player and play lasts for ten turns.

## Phases per Turn
Each turn consists of 6 short phases, these happen with all players undertaking each in sequence, clockwise. A turn ends after the last player has completed phase 6.
1. Receive money for successful products (Not in 1st turn)
2. Buy and allocate resources or use income stream
3. Draw and play events
4. Draw and bring personalities into play
5. Draw products
6. Build products and adjust scores

### Receive money for successful products (Not in 1st turn)
In this phase players receive money for any products already built, remove one pile of money from the card and add it to your bank account space. Everything in Chip Shop needs money. Selling products makes money and it's spent on everything else. If a player runs out of money they are declared [bankrupt](concepts/bankrupt) and must start the game again as a new company (as in setup phase), the only score a player retains is their loyalty along with any other cards that state they remain with bankrupt players.

> Jane built the [Atari 5200](cards/Atari_5200) last turn and so receives 4 money. She intends to build a [control pad](cards/Control_pad) accessory to attach the console and thus buys one Staff, R&D and Marketing resource, saving one money for future use.

### Buy and allocate resources to costs or use income stream
**Unless affected by events or personalities, 1 resource of any kind = 1 money. Players need to plan for what they think they will need for products in production and potential future products.

Players then allocate these resources to the accumulative costs required for products in [production](concepts/inproduction).**

#### Buy and Allocate Resources
Each product and personality and event will require a certain amount of resources indicated on the card. Resources are also used for other aspects of the game.

##### Marketing
There's no point having a great idea and product if no one hears about it. Marketing resources represent an investment in the promotion of a product. It can also represent how familiar people are with the concepts behind a product.

The marketing value you assign to a product equals the amount of turns it will make profit for, i.e.

**1 marketing resource = 1 turn (profitlength) of profit (profitscore)**

Some more groundbreaking or experimental products may have positive score values present next to the marketing cost (marketingcost), this indicates extra effort needed to sell an item to the public. Some products have a negative value next to the marketing cost (marketingcost) this indicates that the public are familar with the product idea and need less convicing to buy it.

##### Staff
Staff are needed to make most things happen, but they are expensive with money and other resources needed to keep them around, or they will leave. When as staff member leaves (or is let go by a player) their positive affects no longer count.

Players always need at least one staff member available or allocated to products in production. If a player runs out of staff they are declared [bankrupt](concepts/bankrupt) and must start the game again as a new company (as in setup phase).

##### Quality
Products require a certain level of quality to balance potential profit and customer satisfaction. Quality products will result in a greater return but require a far greater investment. Shoddier products are quicker and cheaper to make but will result in lower loyalty and longevity.

##### Research & Development
Good ideas aren't (always) conjured out of thin air. They take months and years of painstaking research and testing to perfect. The R&D score dictates how many cards a player can draw from the product deck every turn.

> Following from the previous phase, Jane intends to build a [control pad](cards/Control_pad) accessory to attach the [Atari 5200](cards/Atari_5200) and thus buys one Staff, R&D and Marketing resource, saving one money for future use.

#### Draw income
There are times when a player doesn't have enough money to do anything or may decide they need some more money to use in a future turn. In this case, instead of allocating resource a player can search the income stream deck for a source of income they desire and can play. This card remains in play whilst still relevant and is then discarded.

### Draw and play events
Despite best efforts in planning and strategy, life has a habit of throwing random occurrences that help or hinder plans. This is represented by the events deck which contains varying positive and negative affects for individual players, all players and the game.

Every player draws two cards in player order:

If an event card is [public](concepts/public), the drawing player must show it to all players and then follow where and when it should be played.
- If an event is marked as [immediate](concepts/immediate), play it immediately.
- If an effect of the card is to draw more cards or other actions, play them immediately.
- If an event card is marked as '[choice](concepts/choice)' a player may hold on to the card to play when they wish.

### Draw and bring personalities into play
These are special individuals who players may want to recruit to their company. Personalities may also decide to join a players company at their own free will. Personalities all have specialties, skills and traits that will positively affect statistics and chances of winning the game. Every player draws in player order a number of staff cards determined by their current _Quality_ plus _Loyalty_ scores, divided by two (rounded down).

If a player can 'play' a staff card, i.e. They have the requisite costs and prerequisites required, that staff card enters play immediately and their effects enacted. If the staff card is [public](concepts/public), they are immediately made public. Any staff cards drawn that a player can't or doesn't want to bring into play are added back the top of the staff card deck before the next player draws.

> John's current _Quality_ score is four and _Loyalty_ score is five, thus John draws four staff cards (9 divided by 2, rounded down to 4). He can afford to employ one staff and replaces the remaing three on the top of the deck.

### Draw products
Products are the main point of Chip Shop and players must produce them during the game to stand any chance of winning. Some are easy and can be completed quickly, others are harder and will require more time and resources. Each will require a combination of cost values and result in a certain change in scores.

Each product may have a range of other factors such as the number of turns it produces profit, one-off or recurring costs and positive or negative effects.

Players may draw a number of cards from the products deck up to their current Research & Development value, but may only keep a maximum of two. This represent products that players have actively decided to work on.

All products have cost and resource requirements that must be met. If a player  can build a product immediately they may do so in the build phase. Otherwise a product is built when a player has the resources required. Remember that products that are never completed will negatively affect scores at the end of the game.

Whilst a player is working on a product it remains private in the R&D area of a players factory. The product remains private until built or other events make it public.

#### Accessories
Accessory products are always attached to an exisiting non-accessory product. Each accessory will specify what it can be attached to and any other requirements. Unless specified, an accessory remains in play for as long as the product it is attached to is in play. Some accessories increase the number of turns a product will be in play for.

Proportional costs and scores for accessories (i.e costs and scores indicated as a fraction value) are always a proportion of the product it is attached to.

### Build products and adjust scores
If players have products in production that can be built, they are built in this phase.

In turn order players take the following steps:
1. Move the product card from their factory into the public playing area.
2. Add piles of money tokens equal to the number of turns the product will remain in play, with each pile containing tokens equal to the profits per turn score.
3. Adjust scores based on the product(s) built. Any revenue the product brings doesn't occur until the beginning of the next turn.

> **UPDATE** - Following from the previous example, Jane successfully builds a [control pad](cards/Control_pad) and attaches it to her [Atari 5200](cards/Atari_5200). The profit score for the Atari 5200 is four per turn for two turns, thus the control pad attached to it gains one profit (a quarter of 4 is 1) per turn for as long as the Atari 5200 remains in play.

# Ending the game
After ten turns the game is over!

If at the end of the final build phase of the final turn a player has products still in production or personalities with requirements yet to be met then there are negative affects to scores.

For each product or staff a player discards they lose half of the loyalty and longevity scores of each card.

For each outstanding loan, players lose five points of Longevity Score.

After this all scores are combined, any special cards considered and applied and the player with the most points wins.

## Scoring during the game
On the score board, each player has three score tracks that match their color. There are tokens to represent the current denomination of your score and the units within it, for example:

If your current score is 13, place 1 '10' value token in the denomination square and your player token at 3 in the units track. When your score reaches 22, you add a second 10 token to the denomination square and move your player token to 2 in the units track.

There are three scoring tracks in Chip Shop and all are of equal importance in winning the game:

## Profit
This represents the amount you've sold throughout the game. It's the easiest to gain, but also the most competitive amongst other players.

## Longevity
Was (and is) your company a bright light that burn out fast or has it laid the ground for a long and sustainable future?

## Loyalty
Did you just churn our products that no one wanted or loved or did you create sources of wonder and inspiration in your customer base?
