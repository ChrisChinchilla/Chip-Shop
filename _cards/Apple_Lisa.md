You release the Apple Lisa computer in 1983 to the business market after spending more than $50 million on development. More than 90 people participate in the design, plus more on the sales and marketing efforts to launch the machine. It retails at US$9,995 and is the very first personal computer system with a graphical user interface (GUI) to be sold commercially. It uses a Motorola 68000 CPU clocked at 5 MHz and had 1 MB RAM. Unfortunately the operating system is not capable of supporting the demands of advanced users and is prone to crash then restart under heavy load from large, complex spreadsheets or graphs produced from them. It is a commercial failure that is unable to compete with the more affordable IBM PC's.
