The Commodore Amiga 1000 is released in July 1985,  the first multi media personal computer released by Commodore International in the Amiga line. The launch is held during a star-studded gala featuring Andy Warhol and Debbie Harry held at the Vivian Beaumont Theater[6] at Lincoln Center in New York City. 

The A1000 includes a daughterboard with 256 KB of RAM into which the core of the operating system is loaded from floppy disk and a built-in composite video output which allows the computer to be connected directly to monitors other than their standard RGB monitor. The A1000 also has a "TV MOD" output, into which an RF Modulator can be plugged in, allowing connection to a standard TV or VCR.
