Chip Shop is a game where players enter the heady world of 1980s America to run their own computer company.

On the cusp of the breakthrough of computers from sterile labs to the living room, Chip Shop aims to recreate the spirit of this wild time. A time when companies crashed and burned, millions were made and lost and where those who sold the most weren't always those etched into history.

Chip Shop uses real products, people and events as much as possible, but gives players the chance to reinvent history. I have tried to get legal clearance on as many of these as I can.

Whilst the base game is based in 1980s America, there is plenty of scope for new era and region expansions and I have incorporates as many hooks as possible to allow for concepts such as campaign and multi-expansion play.

I come from an open source software background and try to embrace innovation and openness in everything I do. During the games development I have maintained an open development process and currently the games assets and production process is available for anyone with reasonable technical knowledge to build their own (lower quality) print at home version. I would like to maintain this version of the game if possible, and have many ideas related to it, but I am flexible.

I feel the game has some very obvious appeal and potential for a kickstarter campaign (and again have many ideas regarding this), but am also interested in exploring opportunities with publishers for a premium boxed version of the game.

If you would like copies of the game components or manual, please [contact us](mail:info@gregariousmammal.com) and we will be happy to talk more.
