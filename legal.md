Whilst designing this game we have tried to create a feeling of nostalgia and historical accuracy. This means that after much consideration, when it comes to product names we have opted to use the real names of products that were released. Trademarks are noted on each mention and in all cases we have attempted to contact the trademark holder to notify them. We will take no response as an 'OK' until we hear otherwise. We hope that those affected by the use of these trademarks will appreciate the homage to their work we are undertaking here and embrace it rather than threaten with legal action.

If we have used your trademark (genuinely) inadvertently and in an unwelcome manner, we apologise wholeheartedly and you can [send us an email](mailto:info@gregariousmammal.com) to let us know you want references removed.
