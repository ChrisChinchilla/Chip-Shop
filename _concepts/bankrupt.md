If a player runs out of money they are declared [bankrupt](concepts/bankrupt) and must start the game again as a new company (as in setup phase). A player retains their remaining personalities, their loyalty score along with any other cards that state they remain with bankrupt players.

If a player takes a 'bankruptcy' income stream action, they may also voluntarily declare bankruptcy.
