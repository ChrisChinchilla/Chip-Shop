title: Staff Loss
---
When a staff member is fired or lost by other means by a player, all other players are offered the option to hire them. In the event of more than one player wanting to hire them, the player with the highest longevityscore gets first choice, if longevityscore is tied, then the player with highest loyaltyscore winds. If no player takes the staff member then place them in the discard pile.
