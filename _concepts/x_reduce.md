title: X Reduce
---

X Reduce is applied to potential products still in the products track, and generally triggered by personalities or events. It allows the player holding the card to build a product at an R&D cost one era lower than the product is in. This results in reduced R&D costs, but the benefits of the era it originally came from. As R&D costs are paid immediately, this means you can still place the product in its original era on your factory to keep track of the scores gained when you release it.

If the product is in era 1, then R&D cost is 1.
