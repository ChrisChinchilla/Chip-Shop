Accessory products are always attached to an exisiting non-accessory product. Each accessory will specify what it can be attached to and any other requirements. Unless specified, an accessory remains in play for as long as the product it is attached to is in play. Some accessories increase the number of turns a product will be in play for.

Generally all accessories make one money per turn for the life of the product they are attached to, however, cards and specialist staff may change this.
