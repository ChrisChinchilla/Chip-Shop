Accessory products are always attached to an exisiting non-accessory product. Each accessory will specify what it can be attached to and any other requirements. Unless specified, an accessory remains in play for as long as the product it is attached to is in play. Some accessories increase the number of turns a product will be in play for.

Proportional costs and scores for accessories (i.e costs and scores indicated as a fraction value) are always a proportion of the product it is attached to.
