Test the value mentioned on the card with all other players. If your value is higher you are the winner, if not, the player with the highest values is winner. This may result in a score or card gain.

In a 'Choice Test', the player who initiates the test may decide on which score the test is based upon. The winner may decide to not accept the card or score, in which case shuffle the card back into the relevant deck.
