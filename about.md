It is the dawn of a new era, with computers becoming affordable and desirable enough that millions now want them in their homes.

In Chip Shop you play the head of a fledgling computer company in 80s America striving for a piece of that action. You have a decade to make your mark, will it be for longevity, loyalty, units shifted or strike a balance between them all?

Throughout the years as you attempt to build your empire, personalities and events will conspire to help and hinder you. Will you be in a position to cope with them or will they derail your carefully made plans?

What about your competitors? Will they be working on something bigger, better and brighter than you? Or just steal your ideas from under your feet and beat you to the publics hearts.

Chip Shop will start in the American 1980s, however, many expansions are planned to allow for game play in different eras, regions and markets.

Aside from official expansions or ‘updates’, we intend to open source many of the tools and resources used to create the game and allow for the community to create its own additions, or ‘patches’.
